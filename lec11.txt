Example:  L = Pre_Maybe, type fusion
--------

Consider functors L, F, G such that

    L o F ~ G o L

i.e., we have a natural isomorphism between L o F and G o L.

Then

    L o F ~ G o L
  =>  { specialize to the fixed point of F }
    (L o F) (u F) ~ (G o L) (u F)
  <=> { composition }
    L (F (u F)) ~ G (L (u F))
  <=> { u F ~ F (u F) }
    L (u F) ~ G (L (u F))
  <=> { definition of fixed point }
    L (u F) is a fixed point of G

Using the machinery of adjoint folds, one can show something stronger:
if L is a left adjoint, then L (u F) is the smallest fixed point of G,
i.e.:

  +------------------------------------------------------+
  | L o F ~ G o L  and L left adjoint  =>  L (u F) ~ u G |
  +------------------------------------------------------+

This is known as _type_fusion_ (See section 8 of Hinze's "Adjoint Folds" paper.)

We can use this to prove the example from the end of Lecture 1:

    List (Maybe a) ~ Maybes a

where

    Maybes a = Done | Skip (Maybes a) | Yield a (Maybes a)

This translates to 

    List o Maybe ~ Maybes

in FUN^FUN.

List is the fixed point of

   F    H  = K 1 + Id x H       -- H, K 1, Id are functors
   F alfa  = id_1 + id x alpha  -- id_1, id, alpha are natural transformation

   u F = List

   Remark: Do not confuse "List" with "List A"!  The latter is the
   least fixed point of the endofunctor F X = 1 + A x X.

Maybes is the fixed point of

   G H      = K 1 + H + Id x H
   G alpha  = id_1 + alpha + id x alpha

   u G = Maybes

If we want to show 

   (u F) o Maybe ~ (u G)

by applying type fusion, L needs to be a functor in FUN^FUN such that

   L (u F) = (u F) o Maybe

therefore, we can take

   L F       =  F o Maybe
   L alpha   =  alpha_Maybe

L is the precomposition with Maybe.

To show that L has a right adjoint, we have to find a functor R :
FUN^FUN -> FUN^FUN and a natural isomorphism of type

    phi : { alpha : L H1 -> H2 } -> { beta : H1 -> R H2 }

The derivation is similar to the one for the projection functor:

    alpha : L H1 -> H2
  <=>  { definition L }
    alpha : H1 o Maybe -> H2
   =>  { introducing arbitrary set Y }
    alpha_Y : H1 (Maybe Y) -> H2
  <=> { introducing H : FUNÂ° -> FUN, H X = { g : H1 X -> H2 Y} }
    alpha_Y \in H (Maybe Y)
   => { Yoneda lemma }
    yon (alpha_Y) \in { beta : Emb (Maybe Y) -> H }
   => { introducing abitrary set X }
    (yon (alpha_Y))_X : Emb (Maybe Y) X -> H X
   <=> { definition Emb, H }
    (yon (alpha_Y))_X : { f : X -> Maybe Y } -> { g : H1 X -> H2 Y }
   <=> { uncurry }
    uncurry (yon (alpha_Y))_X : { f : X -> Maybe Y } x H1 X -> H2 Y
   <=> { swap }
    swap (uncurry (yon (alpha_Y))_X) : H1 X x { f : X -> Maybe Y } -> H2 Y
   <=> { curry }
    curry (swap (uncurry (yon (alpha_Y)_X))) :
       H1 X -> { g : { f : X -> Maybe Y } -> H2 Y }
   <=> { introducing R G X = { g : { f : X -> Maybe Y } -> G Y } }
    curry (swap (uncurry (yon (alpha_Y)_X))) :
       H1 X -> R H2 X

Exercise: show that R is a functor.

Since Y was arbitrary, we can take

   phi alpha = curry (swap (uncurry (yon (alpha_X))_X)

Exercise: show that phi is a natural isomorphism.


The distributivity condition

    L o F ~ G o L

with L = o Maybe, F H = K 1 + Id x H, G H = 1 + H + Id x H is easily
checked:

    (L o F) H X
  =  { composition }
    (L (F H)) X
  =  { definition L }
    ((F H) o Maybe) X
  =  { composition }
    F H (Maybe X)
  =  { definition F }
    1 + (Maybe X) x H (Maybe X)
  =  { definition Maybe }
    1 + (1 + X) x H (Maybe X)
  ~  { distributivity }
    1 + H (Maybe X) + X x H (Maybe X)
  =  { definition G }
    G (H (Maybe X))
  =  { definition L }
    G (L H) X
  =  { composition }
    (G o L) H X
